Module 8 â€“ Implementation of Real time systems with FREE RTOS on STM32

Semaphore:
	A signal between tasks/interrupts that does not carry any additional data. The meaning of the signal is implied by the semaphore object, so you need one semaphore for each purpose. The most common type of semaphore is a binary semaphore, that triggers activation of a task.

 

Deadlock:
	A deadlock is a situation in which two computer programs sharing the same resource are effectively preventing each other from accessing the resource, resulting in both programs ceasing to function. The earliest computer operating systems ran only one program at a time.


Race Condition:
	A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly.
